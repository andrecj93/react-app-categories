## apps_listing v0.1 by André Jordão

This project was first bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tasks done

- List all the apps
- Paginate the list (page size = 3)
- Filter the apps as you type in the search bar
- Have all the existing categories in the left navigation sorted by alphabetic order
- Allow filtering of apps when we click on a category
- Apps should be sorted by ascending order of the sum of the plans price

## Info

When typing in the search bar, results will be reflected to the selected category on the left navigation. 
Also created a filter to select all categories - If "All Categories" menu is selected the results will reflect on all categories.

## Other Notes

I only have 2 weeks with React and only a few days using React Hooks. 
If there's anything that is not up to the standards of React, I'm sorry but I have tried my best. :) 


## In the project directory, you can:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
